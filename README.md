# Few things tinyraycaster is NOT:
* it is NOT a game, it is a mere stub;
* it is NOT even a 3d engine;
* it is NOT a competitor for id Software products. People, please, I am not John Carmack and neither my students are. Focus on the word "initiation".

# Few things tinyraycaster IS:
* it IS a blank you can start from
* it IS a project you can participate to, pull requests are welcome, and anyone can edit the wiki
* it IS created in one day, check the commit history. I broke my leg, so I code instead of walking!
* it IS full of bugs. Bugreports are welcome!

As an example, [here are the sources](https://github.com/stephane-hulot/thanksgiving-party) for the game made by my students Salih Nascimento and Stephane Hulot, also check the following youtube video for a preview:
